## Getting Started

### Using Docker (Recommended)

To start the app in development mode using Docker, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project root directory.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up dev
```

This will build the Docker image (if not already built) and start the app in development mode.

### Without Docker

Alternatively, you can run the development server without Docker:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
